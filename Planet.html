        <div class="contentmid">
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 4,879 kilometers. 
            It is also the closest planet to the sun, with an orbital period of just 87.97 days. Mercury's surface temperature 
            ranges from -173°C to 427°C, and it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of helium and oxygen. Despite its proximity 
            to the sun, Mercury has no moons.Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen, which cannot retain heat. As a result, the planet experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, with surface temperatures ranging from -173°C (-279°F) at night to 427°C (800°F) during the day. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling the Moon. Mercury has no moons and takes about 88 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun, but a single rotation on its axis takes 59 Earth days, causing long days and nights.

            <p>Venus, often called Earth's twin due to its similar size and mass, has a thick atmosphere
                 composed mostly of carbon dioxide. This atmosphere traps heat, making Venus the hottest planet 
                 in the solar system with surface temperatures reaching up to 462°C. Venus has no moons and orbits 
                 the sun every 224.7 days.It orbits the Sun at a distance of about 108.2 million kilometers (67.2 million miles). Venus has a diameter of 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles) and a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet in the Solar System with surface temperatures around 465°C (869°F). The dense atmosphere creates a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat and leading to extreme conditions</p>

The presence of liquid water on the surface is unique to Earth and vital for life. Earth’s surface temperature varies widely, from -88°C (-126°F) in the polar regions to 58°C (136°F) in deserts. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, which influences the planet’s tides. </p>

        <div class="contentmid">
            <p>
                Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is known as the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is located about 227.9 million kilometers (141.6 million miles) from the Sun. Mars has a diameter of 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles) and a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of nitrogen and argon. Surface temperatures on Mars range from -125°C (-195°F) during winter nights at the poles to 20°C (68°F) during summer days at the equator. The planet has the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and a vast canyon system, Valles Marineris.

        <div class="contentmid">
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System, with a diameter of 139,820 kilometers (86,881 miles). It orbits the Sun at a distance of about 778.5 million kilometers (484 million miles). Jupiter is a gas giant, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a small rocky core. Its atmosphere features prominent bands of clouds and the Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has raged for at least 400 years. Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field and at least 79 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System.</p>

        <div class="contentmid">
            <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is well known for its stunning ring system. It orbits at an average distance of about 1.43 billion kilometers (886 million miles) from the Sun and has a diameter of 116,460 kilometers (72,366 miles). Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Its rings are made of ice and rock particles that vary in size. Saturn has 83 known moons, with Titan being the largest and the second-largest moon in the Solar System. Titan has a thick atmosphere and is of great interest to scientists studying prebiotic conditions.

        </div>
        <div class="contentmid">
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of about 2.87 billion kilometers (1.78 billion miles). It has a diameter of 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles) and is classified as an ice giant due to its composition of water, ammonia, and methane ices. The presence of methane gives Uranus its characteristic blue-green color. Uranus has a unique axial tilt of 98 degrees, meaning it rotates on its side, which causes extreme seasonal variations. A single rotation takes about 17 hours, while it takes 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.

        <div class="contentmid">
            <p>Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, orbits at a distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles). It has a diameter of 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles) and, like Uranus, is an ice giant. Neptune's blue color is also due to methane in its atmosphere. It is known for its strong winds and storms, including the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest, notable for its retrograde orbit and geysers spewing nitrogen ice.
